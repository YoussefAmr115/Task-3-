### Inputs used:
- **no_obstacles:** number of obstacles
- **initpos[0]:** initial position x for the robot
- **initpos[1]:** initial position y for the robot
- **initpos[2]:** initial theta 
- **targetpos[0]:** initial position x for the target
- **targetpos[1]:** initial position y for the target

### Outputs generated:
- map display showing the robot, obstacles and the target
- targets placed in coordinates each time the code runs


## Code function:
The main purpose of the code is to display the simulation of a robot with a target both positions set by the user when is asked, the user also determines the number obstacles placed randomly on the map , the target that is set must be reached by the robot without colliding with any of the obstacles that are set.

## Further improvments
- The robot needs to detect if there is obstacles on the starting point or the target
- The robot needs to improve creating new paths in a more advanced way when meeting obstacles
